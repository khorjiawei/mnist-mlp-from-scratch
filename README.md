# mnist-mlp-from-scratch

Notebook for getting hands dirty on a multilayer perceptron (implemented from scratch with numpy, and tested on MNIST dataset). This implementation is meant for myself to get started with the theory of deep learning. This implementation is not optimised at all as the focus of this mini project is the theory!
